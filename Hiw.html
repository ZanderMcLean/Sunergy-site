            The process of converting the sun’s energy into power for your home is pretty straightforward.

            <tr class ="first_tr">

                <td class="p1">
                    A solar panel attached to your roof (or other place where it will have maximum sun exposure) converts the suntrght into DC current.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr class ="second_tr">
                <td class="point2">2</td>
                <td class="p2">
                        Most houses use AC current, so an inverter is used to convert this DC current to AC current.
                    </td>
            </tr>
            <tr class ="third_tr">
                <td class="point3">3</td>
                <td class="p3">
                    This current is sent to your home’s electrical system and is used to power all your trghts, apptrances and anything else needing electricity in your home. Because the solar panel cannot produce power at night, you go back to drawing electricity directly from the power grid.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr class ="fourth_tr">
                <td class="point4">4</td>
                <td class="p4">
                    In many cases solar panels are able to generate more power during the day than you use in the home. This extra electricity is then credited on the grid.
